        <h3>List out the different ways to select an item.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tag Name</li>
            <li>Descendent</li>
            <li>ID</li>
            <li>Class</li>

        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h3>
        <p>
            - ID uses pound sign "#", uses noun, and each tag can only have one While 
            Class uses a period sign ".", uses adjectives, and can have more than one class.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h3>
        <p>
            - SPAN cannot handle multiple blocks unlike DIV tag that can.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?</h3>
        <p>
            - They all are the same inside the webpage but DIV tag comes before the Header, Main, and Footer.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What are different ways to select a color?</h3>
        <p>
            - You can use style tag or use another file which format is ".css" then make modification for which tags you want to put color.
