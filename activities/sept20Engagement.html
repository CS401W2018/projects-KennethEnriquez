    <H3>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</H3>

    <p>
        Absolute Link - You can put links and those links can be from your own work, or from other websites.
        <br>
        <br>
        Relative Link - You can only add links that are from your own work.
        <br>
        You use relative link if you are only going to include links that are from your own work.

        <em>List 3 rules with relative links</em>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Periods (.) - It means current folder</li>
            <li>Two Periods (..) - Parent folder</li>
            <li>Slash (/) - Meaning at the beginning, start at the root.</li>
        </ol>
