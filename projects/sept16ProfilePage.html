    <h1>Aloha, My name is Kenneth Enriquez</h1>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Darasa tanauan City Batangas, Philippines. I am originally assigned to Philippines Davao Mission but due to pandemic,
        I was reassigned to my home mission the Philippines San Pablo Mission. I love playing basketball and football. Every wednesday and friday nights,
        I play with my friends. Right now, we're doing football team practice for the intramurals. I recently sprained my wrist that's why right now, I'm a bit 
        struggling for practice but last saturday, we did practice some plays. we did some 20 yard dash, do passing, and did practice playing defense. It was fun and exciting.
        <br>

        More fun facts about me is that I love listening to music. I always have my airpods with me wherever I go. And every time I listen to music, I set it in max
        volume becuase I enjoyed listening that way and I only want to hear the music and nothing else such as the noice outside or the sounds that the crowd make.
        Right now, I am also collecting some dope shoes. I plan to buy Jordan 1 low, jordan 3, and jordan 4. I am just into shoes. when I came here in Hawaii,
        I brought 7 shoes with me. I recently bought the LBJ 21, Air force 1, and the Jordan 38 low. I don't have any Idea how I will be able to bring them home haha. Its only my 
        3rd semester here and I already bought 3. 
        <br>
        <br>
        These are the list of the shoes I want to buy this semester.
