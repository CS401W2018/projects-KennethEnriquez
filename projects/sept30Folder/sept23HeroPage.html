            Every time people asked me who is the G.O.A.T in the NBA, I always say Michael Jordan.
            Why? Because he spimply is the best. He is the best at shooting, defending, and leading 
            the team to championships. He is better compared to Lebron James, and Kobe Briant. Some 
            people said that they are all G.O.A.T but for me, Michael Jordan is the only G.O.A.T.
