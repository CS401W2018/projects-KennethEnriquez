        <h2>Sneaker Head</h2>
        <p>
            I started to like sneakers back when I bought my first pair of Lebron 13s. 
            After that, my passion for sneakers went crazy. I love looking on the shop, 
            both online and in-store on whats new especially those that are unique and 
            limited pairs. Right now, I just baught Air Jordan 4 colaboration with A Ma Maniere.
            Back in the Philippines, I baught Lebron 13, Alpha bounce, 
            Adidas explosive, Alpha bounce 2, Jordan Zion 1, Lebron 19, 
            Air Force 1 Triple white, Lebron 21 Protect the Pearl, and 
            Jordan 38 Coconut Milk. These shoes are just a few of all the shoes
            I baught in the Philippines. These are my favorite kicks I use for
            casualwear or when I play basketball.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
            I love listening to music. I always have my air Pods in my pocket so whenever I'm 
            outside, I can always listen to my favorite musics. The artist that I always listen to are 
            Post malone, Hev abi, Khalid, Al James, Ben & Ben, and The Weeknd. My Favorite album to listen 
            right now is "American Teen" by Khalid and "F-1 Trillion: Long Bed" by Post malone.
