                    Downhill bikes are built specifically for riding steep, rocky, and technical descents at high speeds. They have heavy-duty suspension and are designed to handle extreme impacts. These bikes are made for riders who focus on going downhill and don’t do much climbing, as they are not efficient for pedaling uphill.

                    Enduro bikes are designed for aggressive mountain biking, with a focus on descending steep, rough trails at high speeds. They are built to handle big impacts and technical descents, but also need to be efficient enough for climbing. Enduro biking involves both climbing and descending, with most of the focus on downhill sections.

                <p class="page3p">
                    Hardcore hardtails are mountain bikes with a front suspension fork but no rear suspension. They’re designed for more rugged terrain and are known for being durable and responsive, especially for riders who want to feel every bump and have more control over their bike. These bikes are typically lighter and more responsive, but can be less comfortable on rough descents.

                <p class="page3p">
                    Downcountry bikes are a mix of cross-country and trail bikes. They are designed for faster, more technical terrain, but still maintain the lightweight and efficient design of XC bikes. These bikes are perfect for riders who want to tackle tougher trails without giving up too much speed.

                <p class="page3p">
                    Trail bikes are built for more varied and technical terrain than XC bikes. They offer a good balance between comfort, durability, and control, making them great for riders who want to explore rougher trails, but don’t need the heavy-duty setup of enduro or downhill bikes.

                <p class="page3p">
                    Cross-country mountain biking (XC) is all about speed and endurance on smooth or mildly rough trails. Riders often tackle long distances with lighter bikes designed for quick pedaling and efficiency. It’s great for people who enjoy covering a lot of ground without too much technical difficulty.
