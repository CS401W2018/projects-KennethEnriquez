            Frame
        </h2>
        <p class="page1p">
            Mountain bike (MTB) frames are the main structure of a bike, built to handle rough terrain and heavy impacts. They are usually made from materials like aluminum, carbon fiber, or steel, which offer strength and durability while keeping the bike lightweight. The frame's design, including the shape of the tubes and the suspension, affects how well the bike performs on trails and rough surfaces.

            Cockpit 
        </h2>
        <p class="page1p">
            The MTB cockpit includes the handlebars, stem, grips, and controls like the brake and gear levers. Its main function is to give the rider control over the bike, allowing them to steer, shift gears, and brake while riding. The cockpit's design helps make riding comfortable and efficient, especially on rough trails.

            Fork
        </h2>
        <p class="page1p">Fork is the front suspension of a mountain bike, located between the handlebars and the front wheel. It absorbs shocks and bumps from rough terrain, making the ride smoother and more stable. The fork helps improve control and comfort, especially when riding on rocky or uneven trails.

            Break Set
        </h2>
        <p class="page1p">
            Breakset is the system that helps slow down or stop the bike, including the brake levers, brake cables, and the brake calipers that grip the wheels. There are two main types: rim brakes, which grip the wheel rims, and disc brakes, which use a rotor and caliper for more powerful braking. The brake set is essential for safety, especially on steep or technical trails.

            Wheel Set
        </h2>
        <p class="page1p">
            Wheelset refers to the complete set of wheels on a mountain bike, including the rims, hubs, spokes, and tires. It plays a key role in how the bike handles on different terrains, as the wheels need to be strong enough to withstand impacts while still being lightweight. A good wheelset helps improve traction, speed, and control on rough trails.

            Group Set
        </h2>
        <p class="page1p">
            Groupset is the collection of parts that control how the bike moves, including the gears, chain, crankset, derailleur, and shifters. It allows the rider to change gears smoothly, making it easier to pedal uphill or downhill. A good groupset helps improve performance, speed, and efficiency on different trails.
