            What is mountain biking?
        </h2>
        <p class="mainp">Mountain biking is a sport where people ride bicycles specially designed for off-road trails. Itâ€™s different from regular biking because the terrain is rough and can include rocks, dirt, and steep hills. Mountain bikes have strong frames, thick tires, and good suspension to handle the bumps and jumps. Riders often explore nature, like forests and mountains, while biking. There are different styles of mountain biking, such as cross-country, downhill, and trail riding, each with its own challenges. Safety is important, so riders usually wear helmets, gloves, and sometimes pads to protect themselves. Mountain biking is not just fun but also a great way to stay fit and enjoy the outdoors.
